Verse progression:
G-7, F#7, F7, E7 | G-7, F#7, F7, G#7 | G-7, F#7, F7, E7 | D#7, D7, G-, G- |


 G-7    F#7      F7                E7
Mother said you turned my food to poison
G-7        F#7         F7                G#7
   To her father on a cold Thanksgiving day
G-7         F#7        F7           E7
   The holidays leave me with anti nausea
    D#7             D7             G-7
And so I turned my head and walked away 

You said I never had to have a reason 
Just for feeling all the feelings that do 
The summer days leave me with anti sneezers 
And drunken was the day that I found you 


Chorus:
C-
Sarah (Sarah)
                                      G-
Oh girl you know I love you and I'll love you for the rest of my life 
C-
Sarah (Sarah)
                                   D7
I'm always thinking of you I'm so sorry I can't make you my wife this life 


Well no one else could make me feel as lonesome
As you made me feel on Thursday night
Because you know it - the world misunderstands me
Only you can make me feel alright

I guess I thought that we could live forever
In a state of such imaginary grace
Where you could find your diamonds in my arms dear
I could find a reason in your face


Chorus 

[Verse progression, played slowly, one strum per chord]
And so I softly drop you at the station 
Slowly turn the key and drive away (ooh ooh ooh...) 
Do you kiss my lips with hesitation 
Because your just afraid of what they might say? 

Chorus 

[Verse progression]
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord I had such plans for us...
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord I had such plans for us...
