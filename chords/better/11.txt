Verse:
F                               Bb    C
  How come you profit while I profit not?
F                      G-7          C

 Bb                     F

And at your head will I aim my swing

How can you use the bucket and draw your fill
While we are waiting at the world still?
Time slows down, the days grow long
But I'm still singing the same old song

Because...

Chorus:

'Cause I see the bucket full
You say it empty
