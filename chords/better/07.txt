Verse:

They say that love is pain
That Cupid's little arrow is a bullet right to your brain
I tell you it's a lie...
'Cause Cupid shot me in the eye and now I'm dumb and blind

All I want to do...
Is just kiss you
All I want to do...
Is just kiss you
But you don't even know me

G              D            A-                  C
  But at this moment, I'll love you through the ages (Through the aaages)
G         D        A-           C
  And I feel that you already know that...
G
I know that you know that I now that you don't know me!
