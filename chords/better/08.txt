You know I'll make you feel alright

Verse:

Maybe I'll write you a letter
Or just drop you a line (How you doin' mamma)
Girl, we've got to get together
Even if it's only for one night

(I wanna love ya)
One, two, three, four, five times tonight
Five, six, seven, eight, nine times tonight
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty-five times tonight
I just wanna love you, baby


Chorus
