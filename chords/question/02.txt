Verse:

A                     C#-          B-
  Storm clouds, they weep (Sha la la)
                E
Bring down the rains upon me
A                C#-          B-
  Like dogs we sleep (Sha la la)
                E
And see flowers in the morning
A              C#-          B-
  Don't understand (Sha la la)
               E
Should you be doomed to speak it
A                C#-          B-
  Hold out your hand (Sha la la)
              E
To spite the rain upon it


Chorus:
  A                      D
Knowing is a two-edged sword
     A                          D
Of what you learned and once ignored
     A                   D
And wisdom is a liquor store
 B-
Tastes so sweet,
 E                                 A      E
Just wait 'til you wake up in the morning


Verse:

Secrets you keep
Never to tell your lover
Talk in your sleep
Into the ear of another
Don't think too much
Whan you look into her eyes
Give her your touch
It's only then I realise
