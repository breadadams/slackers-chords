Intro:
G


Verse:

G
  Six months of separation
C                Eb7                  G
  And you never laugh when I call anymore
G                                           C
  The sound of your voice, it echoes in my head
              Eb7              A-7   D7
  Like I was dead, but not in heaven

C-                B-              A-
  All the fancy places we used to go
C-          B-           A-7             D7
  How far away, like a dream I used to know


Chorus:

            F                  G
And so you wonder... Why... I cry
            F                  G
And so you wonder... Why... I cry


Verse:

Six hours flying home
And there's no warm hand here to meet me
Only the push of a baggage carosel
Is the only sound that greets me

Staring out the window on the ride home
Faces look at me like they know that I'm alone


Chorus

Insrumental Interlude


Verse:

Six years in New York City
And I'm back on the block where I say I'm living
The neighbors I know by face, they don't know me
I never met them to begin with

Opening my door down on president
Remembering all the postcards that I wrote but never sent.


Chorus

Ending:
F
  Six years in New York City
G
  Six years in New York City
F
  Six years in New York City
G
  Six years in New York City
       F
And I wonder...
