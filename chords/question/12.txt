When you say you love me

Instrumental (Verse Chords)

Verse:

So if you say you love me
Won't you promise you'll stay
After love's gone away
'Cause I know without you
I might die (I might die, gril)

I'm only asking, only asking
'Cause I wonder at night
When you turn out the light
Is your love, your love
As weak as mine?


Ending:

(Yeah girl)
(You know I should love you)

         C
Is your love
            D
As weak as mine?   x3
         A
Is your love
            G    A
As weak as mine?
