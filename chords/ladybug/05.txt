Vic Ruggiero - American Psychopath (Chords)


Verse:
                    E
I get high off the sunset
                         A
I waste my time singin' love songs
                     E
I buy my lover in a magazine
       D
She is all I need
    A
To get me asleep tonight

                          E
I send my screams to the dark sky
                   A
I use my pain as a alibi
                      E
I breathe deep off a desert wind
    D
Contained within
     A
Her carriage, corn-fed sight


Chorus:
                      E
'Cause I'm American psychopath
                          A
I'm goin' home to watch bloodbath
                     E
I can watch it on my TV screen
      D
It is all I need
    A
To get me asleep tonight
                       E
I like the feeling of light beer
       D
And potato skin
    A
To put before my nose
                      E
I get the feeling of sour cream
     D
And razor blades
 A
Deep inside my clothes
                        E
Wearin' shoes that are too tight
  D
Friday night, seventy-nine
 A
Polyester nose
                E
American psychopath
          D
Oh mama, yes I am
    A
And everybody knows


Verse:

She got a dress like a radio
She got a voice like a echo
She got shoes like cinder blocks 
With white socks
And cockfight polkadots bright

I watch her eyes like a TV set
As she connects me to the outlet
The soft admission of cold electric
Into my veins
It's like a ripe and red in a sunset


Chorus:

'Cause I'm American psychopath
I'm goin' home to watch bloodbath
I can watch it on my TV screen
It is all I need
To get me asleep tonight

I'm American psychopath
Oh mama, yes I am
Oh make me feel alright

I'm American psychopath
Mama, yes I am
Make me feel alright

I'm American psychopath
Yes I am
Make me feel alright

I'm a psychopath
Mama, yes I am
Make me feel alright

I'm American psychopath
Mama, yes I am
Make me feel alright

I'm American psychopath
Mama, yes I am
