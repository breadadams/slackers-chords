C#                                 F#
   Remember driving home from the park

  You yelled at me about my porno mags

Chorus:

Do you remember all those lonely nights together
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
Honey, I remember every one


Verse:

Remember when you threw my clothes out the window
You know it's pretty clear that way
To see which way the wind blows
Remember how I left the light on
You didn't like like that ver much
You really put the bite on


Chorus:

Do you remember all those lonely nights together
More than our sweet days, our sweet days in the sun
Do you remember all those nights went on forever
Honey, I remember every one


Spoken (Verse Chords):

And you remember that time that,
Well, I don't have to go into that. That time...
The other time, when I was comin' home and you were...
Well I know you couldn't forget, the time I said...
I know, we can laugh about that now...
