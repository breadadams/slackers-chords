My education wqas my own self deprecation and it's
Waiting in shadows in the back of my mind
Whispering melodies and tainting the world I see it
Visions of tragedy and esses and lines

Self medication
Self medication
Everyone knows it's just a matter of time

Self medication
Self medication
Everyone wants to have a little of mine


Bridge:
Bb
   For boredom to blasphemy I'm
Eb
   Acting so maniacally, but
Ab
   It supports the fallacy that
Eb
   There's something to find

Bb
   Can I express myself, I
Eb
   Know it's bad for my health, but
Ab
   It's filling this meaninglessness
G
   With riddles and rhymes


verse:

So maybe a pleasure trip to foreign seas
Would make the days easier you spend with me
Or fancy casino trips that rob you blin
We're counting in poker chips and bottles of wine


Chorus:

Self medication
Self medication
Everyone knows it's just a matter of time

Self medication
Self medication
Everyone wants to have a little of mine
