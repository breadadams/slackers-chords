Verse:
F               C            Bb                 F
  I forget the lines, but I don't forget the streets
F                   C    Bb             F 
  We still hit the road, we still gotta eat
    F               C        Bb              F
I still put on my trousers twelve legs at a time
 F                  C         Bb                 F
You're all sons of bitches, still I'll make it rhyme

And though I couldn't tell you exactly what went wrong
 F                C      Bb             F
We still stick together, we still get along


Break:

F    C    Bb            F
  Oooooh...  Yeah yeah yeah!


Verse:

We have seen the fashion changing with the day
We have seen the mighty crumble and swept away
I'm sure I'll see the tiny grow up strong and cruel
Don't tink for a minute I'll obey their rules


Chorus

Break

Instrumental Break (Verse Chords)

Verse:

Now, some folks see a reason, and some folks see a plan
And some say that their faith can fill what they don't understand
But to hell with human drama, and the fight of right and wrong
I'm just waiting forthe day that I won't be here to see what's going on


Chorus
          F                C      Bb             F
You know we still stick together, we still get along


Ending:

F C Bb Db
