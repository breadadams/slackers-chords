JPember


Intro:

F


Verse:
           F
I spent three years learning how to talk
           Bb             F
The next thirty learning not to
  F
Two years learning how to walk
           G-7             C7
About the same for a motorcycle
 F
Eight years living in a powder keg
            Bb                F
But only a moment to light a match
         F                    D7
But then I found you and you found me too
     Bb    C7         F
And now I just don't have to


I walked five miles up a hill through a foot of snow
To make a phone call home on your birthday
I swam eight miles fighting off a hammerhead shark
To get your present there by Thursday
Climb a thousand foot hill using only one hand
Just to tell the world of my convictions
But you already knew that our love grew
And now I just don't have to


Instrumental Break (Same Chords)

verse:

I spent no time taking you for granted
And I guess that I never will now
A lot of time thinking about your love
A'cause it's giving me such a thrill now
Sunday morning I'm thanking the Lord for you
With a quick nod to the devil
I was so blue, just fighting for you
And now I just don't have to


Ending:
  Bb     C7         F
Uhuh, I just don't have to
        Bb    C7         F
I said now I just don't have to
Bb   C7            F
  I just don't... Have to
