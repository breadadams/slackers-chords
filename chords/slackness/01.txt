  He's in love with rock 'n' roll (woah)

  And he knows what he's got to do

He knows... He's gotta have fun with you (You lucky lady!)

Verse:

In the in-tray is lots of work
But the boss at the firm always thinks he shirks
But he's just like everyone, he's got a Ford Cortina
That just wont run without fuel (Oooh...)
Fill her up, Jacko!

And the invoice it dont quite fit
No payola in his alphabetical files

Gonna really let him know exactly how he feels
