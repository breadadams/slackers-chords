Chorus:
  F                        G-7
I try to keep it simple so you understand
    Bb                         F
I'm giving all the love that I can
  F                        G-7
I try to keep it simple so you understand
    Bb                         F
I'm giving all the love that I can


Verse:
     F
On a fall day
          D-7
You would ask me
       Bb
For my love
   F      C
My friend
    F         C         D-7      Bb
You said that   I could trust you
         F                 C       F   C
Yeah you said you're gonna   be my man


Ooh but one lie
Led to another
And I know that I lied myself
One lie
Lead to another lie
But how many men did our lies kill?


Chorus

Verse:

C'mon! You keep giving your excuses
Lord knows I've heard them all
But so has your momma and the F.B.I.
And they're both listenin' through the wall

Well they said one lie leads to another
I told it to my policeman
He said: "Yes, one lie leads to another lie
"And how many lies kill how many men?"


Chorus

Bridge:
             D-
What part of love
               A-
Don't you understand?
                  Bb
Say, what part of love
               A-     C
Don't you understand?


Verse:

Some folks say "Vic, take it easy"
Some folks say "Man, take a walk"
Well, maybe I'll take myself on the old Red Hook
And throw myself off the dock

And maybe if you see my body floatin' on by
Won't ya throw me down a wreath
Then you can send my bleedin' heart off the Washington
And write "Attention: Commander In Chief"

Woo!


Chorus

Ending:
         F
Said I try to...
         G-7
Keep it simple...
         Bb
So that you would...
       F
Understand...
    F           C             D-7       Bb       F     C        F
The only thing worse in the whole wide world is another silent man
         F           C            D-7      Bb             F     C        F
Said the only thing worse in the god damn world would be another silent man

             F   C         D-7
You know I try to keep it simple
Bb      F           C           F   Bb F
I give you all the love that I can
