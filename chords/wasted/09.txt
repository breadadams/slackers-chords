Intro:

F
F C Bb F


Verse:
F              C
Something has torn me
Bb         F
Karma has rolled me
F         C
God is a commie
Bb           F
Sweet Jesus told me

F               A7
He said if you lost him
     Bb           F
To please send a basket
     F         C
And fire your musket
Bb       F
Over my casket


Chorus:
Bb              F
Roll out the stretcher
     Bb           C7
And make me feel better

             F              C
For what is bad, Don't be glad
             Bb             F
for what is worse, I'm the nurse


Verse:

Baby, don't you give me
Your words of sweet whisky
Your southern drawl crawling
over me quickly

You see I've been lied to,
Laughed at, and cried to
But I'm no longer
Twisted and tied to


Chorus

Insrumental Interlude
(Intro/Verse)

Verse:

Sweet road out yonder
Know I have gone her
So teach me no lesson
And call when you wanna

Sweet whores I've implored
To lay me some wisdom
They said know what you want and
Just ask to receive it


Chorus

For what is bad, don't be glad
For what is worse, I'm the nurse
