Not your enemy

Verse:
                    A-
It was never my intention
             G
To drive you away
                   A-
You choose your direction
                     E-
Where you would not say
                           A-
And I hear that things are ending
                       E-
And you're hidng from me
                  A-
You think that I sold you out
                C
That's in your mind

That's in your mind


Chorus:
             G
It may be a long time
                   D
Ooh a long time indeed
                           A-
I may not be a friend you want
                           G
But I'm a friend that you need


Verse:

Now you think that I've forgotten
When you helped me out
I was down on my race
And you pulled me out
Where I was living
From the street at the end
Don't think I forgot all that
Do ya?
Do ya my friend?

             G
It may be a long time
                   D
Ooh a long time indeed
                           A-
I may not be a friend you want
                           C
But I'm a friend that you need

             G
It may be a long time
                   D
Ooh a long time indeed
                           A-
I may not be a friend you want
                           G
But I'm a friend that you need

When you're done with your... Cocaine and speed
