Chorus:
C                        F
If I could just keep my head up
           C                       F
Like the trees down on henderson swamp
     C                         F
And make another day, that'll be O.K.
       G-7         C           F
And I won't just die another chump


Verse:
         C                   F
Well my head's been wed with envy
    C                     F
My feet's been tied with sin
      C                       F
The sweet smell of death is upon my breath
    G-7              C
For every stroke I swim


    C          F
My history forgets me
     C             F
Notify my next of kin
       C                         F
'Cause I fear it true that your head would hang too if you knew
G-7         C           F
  All the trouble I was in


Chorus

Verse:

Well my pennies have all left my pockets
Down by where my guitar sleeps
Along with the ladies that I've left behind
Who now line the old back streets


Instrumental Interlude (over second half of verse)

Bridge:
         D7
Well my cap they call confusion
         G7
And the water come a-rushin' on in
C
I look to heaven and ask in fear
   G-7                       C
"Please Lord tell me how did I get here!"


Verse:

He said "Young man you had to be angry
"Oh, young man you had to be free
"Yup, sounds correct and I hope that you're happy
"Sinkin' on, deep into the sea"
