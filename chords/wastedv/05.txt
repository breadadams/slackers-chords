The Slackers - Wasted Days (Chords)

Intro:

G#, C#


Verse:
                                         G#    C#
What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
G#              C#                    G#   C# G#
  You broke my heart, you left in no hurry
G#                       A#m
  What I'm sorry for, is all those wasted days
    C#                   D#       G#       C# G#
And all those wasted ways that I loved you


What didn't I do that made you want to leave me?
My life was so full, now it seems so empty
What I didn't do was lvoe you every night,
likfe I wanted to be alive if I couldn't love you

Instrumental Interlude

Verse:

I'll find another before this night's over
She may not be you, I might not be sober
But I'll make love with her until the mornin' light,
Thinkin' all the while, how I cold love you.

What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
What have I done wrong...
What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
...That I should be sorry?


Afterwards, there is a dub version of the song, which has
the same chords and structure, but there are no lyrics.
