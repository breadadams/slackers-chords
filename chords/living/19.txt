Vic Ruggiero – Junkie Parents (Chords)

Intro:

E


Verse:
      E
Your junkie parents jinxed me on the train the other night

All the old folks in your closet, all the spiders tucked in tight
         A
I don’t need no family doctor - I don’t want your Caroline
        E
I will kill your Californian, but I love to hear you whine
               B                                        Bb A
Sometimes you got to get away, got to get away, got to get out
           E
Well your junkie parents jinxed me on the train the other night


Said your junkie parents jinxed me when they got right on the train
What quiet, sweaty kids they had with soft, demented brains
I try hard to edge forward, but I could not stand the magnet-puller
Junkie, whining, contemplating – Comments just an order for me
Junkie, junkie robo-funky, do you wanna see my monkey?
Bouncing like a bouncer baby ball inside your junkie mamma


Your junkie parents jinxed me on the train the other night
All the old folks in your closet, all the spiders tucked in tight
I don’t need no family doctor - I don’t want your Caroline
I will kill your Californian, but I love to hear you whine
Sometimes you got to get away, got to get away, got to get out
Well your junkie parents jinxed me on the train the other night


Ending:
      E                                                    A E
Your junkie parents jinxed me on the train the other night
               B                                        Bb A
Sometimes you got to get away, got to get away, got to get out
 E
Junkie. Jinxed me. Train. Night.
