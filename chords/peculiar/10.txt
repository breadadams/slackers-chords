Intro:

E G#7 C#- A


Verse:
E                            G#7
  When I was young all them teachers taught me
C#-                            A
  In the old books that their Cold War bought me
E                            G#7
  They said like dominos this whole wide world could
C#-                             A
  Just all to pieces like they wish that old Middle East would


Chorus:
E           G#7    C#-    A
  But international war criminal
E       G#7  C#-  A
  Information is minimal
     E              G#7
The weapons of destruction
          C#-             A
They are gasoline and petroleum
E               G#7               C#-      A
  And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
E           G#7               C#-      A
  Are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?


Verse:

I heard they found one in a hole, man
White lights crawlin' on his brown skin
But ain't it shameful just being human?
No, it's old as original sin that white light's always creepin' in


Chorus:

And international war criminals
Situation is typical
The weapons of destruction
They're just gasoline and petroleum
And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
And will they stick around to see what happens?


Verse:

International rules of war, they get spoken
When it suits someone to have them broken
It's funny how they'll go on and define "terror"
As killing and exploding things to force your own agenda


Chorus:

But international war criminal
Situation is critical
The weapons of destruction
They are gasoline and petroleum
And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
And will they stick around to see what happens?
The international war criminals
The international war criminals
The information, oh, it's minimal
The international war criminal
