Verse:
A
Every single day
             B
I keep on a-wishing my life away
                       D
So now it's that I've nothing quite so say
               A
I don't know what to do


These things seem to happen all the time
Coming from a very fragile mind
I'm expecting some to act in kind
Well tell me what's with you

I said I really can't complain
Considering the changes in my brain
I feel, I think, I'm going quite insane
And now, that's something new


Pre-Chorus:
A                  F#
  (And so that's) Just as if you can
   B
A castle made of sand
      F
It's falling in the water
A               F#
  And I (???) looking at my hands
 B
(???)
      F
The flowers that I bought her


Chorus (Same as Intro):
A           G
All I ever...
     F#          G
It's all I ever wanted   x4


Verse:

Every single day
I (???) moving far away
So now it's that I haven't got a say
I our future

And every single night
She never seems to hold me quite as tight
And then she brings me gasoline
When I ask for water

I can't really say
Being that she stole my heart away
I'm feeling I can't live another day
But then I (???) her
