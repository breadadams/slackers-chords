Intro:

B- D  x2


Verse:
                         B-
When you turn and walk away
                       D
I swear I could see forever
                            B-
When I hear the things you say
                              D    D7
You know they stay with me forever


Chorus:
               G                         D   B-
And then you cry, though I never shed a tear
              E-                               D    D7
And then you cry, you tell me "Stay away from here"
            G           G-           D  B-
I ask you why, but you never, never say
          E-               A7              D
And so I say, I say I'll stay, I'll stay away


Verse:

When I pay you compliments
You always prefer if I don't say
So it's no coincidence
That I get so carried away

Verse:

Remember when I kissed your lips
They were soft and so familiar
And you go and tell me this
Oh, that you really meant to kill her
