  Things have changed
Bb                 C

B          C         F
  I won't see you... Anymore


Verse:

Just stands to reason
That your bridge can take
Only so much weight
Before it breaks

I take the long road
Whereever I can
But I won't take the wrong road
In your long traffic jam


Chorus

Instrumental Interlude

Verse:

See, I'm not above
Just fighting for love
If I can't be
Oh, I can't be

And I'm not before
Abiding by laws
But all I ask
Is set me free, set me free


Chorus
