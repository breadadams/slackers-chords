Verse:

All night long
I drink whiskey from my dish
I dream of yester days
And I hope and cry and wish
I wish my master had the heart
not to shoot his old dog
But I have no teeth left
And I'm pink, just like a hog


Chorus

Insrumental Interlude

Verse:

As they lay me down
The sleep, it fills my eyes
I hear my master load his gun
And then he shoots me twice
And as I fade to black
I think about my youth
The days when I was strong
And the world was so new
