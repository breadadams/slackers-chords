Verse:
Bb            Eb          Bb
  I know, so many people told me
Gb    Ab       Db      F
  I know from times before
Bb               Eb          Bb
  Why those who don't even know me
Eb         Bb       F        Bb
  Why they always write the law


Wise man, well he said "I know,
"Easy come is easy go"
But were you born to suffer?
Ask him, man, he just don't know

Eb             F        Bb
  Well, here it comes again


Verse:

No I won't try to roll ya
Though you're an easy mark
Just think what your mama told ya
Don't pet squirrels in the ark

It's alright 'cause you say what you're feelin'
Way quiet in the dark
But when you're in the sunlight kneelin'
Well, who you gonna say you are


Chorus

  Now dig deep, for the bottle
Gb             Ab
  It's alright, you take it slow
Gb          Db
  Dig deep, for the bottle
Gb                  F
  You'll need it, this I know
