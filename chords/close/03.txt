Eb              C-            F-          Bb7

  What do you say when you know you are wrong?

Eb            C-     F-   Bb7
  It doesn't seem so accidental, but
Eb          C-       F-        Bb7        Eb       C-         F-
  When you hit your head, your axes they fall (Sha la la la la)
Bb7
  And that's all

Eb             C-       F-     Bb7
  You call me mean and temperamental, but
Eb          C-       F-        Bb7        Eb       C-         F-
  When you hit your head, your axes they fall (Sha la la la la)
Bb7          Eb         C-       F-  Bb7
  And that's all  (Sha la la la la)


Verse:

You hit your head when you get too high
You hit your head when you grow too tall
You hit your head when you stand - I don't know why
You hit your head and I guess that is all, so


Chorus

Instrumental Interlude

Verse:

Well people say that you're such a saint
Well you and I, we know that you ain't
Well heaven knows that the devil's alive
In your smile and your soft demeanor


Chorus
