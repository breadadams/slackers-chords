Only making more pollution

War for pride and retribution
Wasted life with no solution

Verse:

Can you tell me where it started?
Was man meant to be broken-hearted?
How does God put me in danger?
They say it's only human nature

Oh, I think this world's gone crazy
I'm tellin' you, man, I think this world's gone mad...


Chorus:

Every day I'm livin' in a world gone crazy (Crazy, crazy, ah)
Every day I'm livin' in a world gone crazy (Crazy, crazy, ah)
Tell me what am I do do, tell me what am I to do now? (Crazy, crazy, ah)
