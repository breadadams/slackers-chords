They say every man can be replaced,
Yet every distance is not near.
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

They say every man needs protection,
They say that every man must fall.
Still I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east.
And any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

Every day in this lonely crowd,
Stands a man who's not to blame.
And every day I hear him shouting so loud,
Crying out that he's been framed.
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.

I shall not, I shall not be moved,
I shall not, I shall not be moved.
(Etc.)
