See, my congressmen to my president
Are all businessmen just schemin'
They tell me who's my enemies and who's my friends,
Well, I'm not sure that I believe them
Streetside posters are encouragin' me peepin'
To report my local terrorists and the company they're keepin'


Chorus:

Propaganda (Propaganda...)
And now it's everywhere I go
It's-a propaganda (Propaganda...)
Man, it's on my radio
Propaganda (Propaganda...)
Everywhere I go
But hey, mister (Mister, please...)
Mister, please tell me what you know


Verse:

Like, who are they in Guantanamo Bay, sir?
There ain't no names, and ain't no crimes written in my paper
The racial prisoner, who's wonderin' why his charge is...
Secret meetings in taxi-cab garages


Chorus:

The propaganda (Propaganda...)
It's everywhere I look
It's-a propaganda (Propaganda...)
It's just like history books
Propaganda (Propaganda...)
It's everywhere I go
But hey, mister (Mister, please...)
Mister, please tell me what you know
Hey, mister... And sister,
Tell me what you know...
