Chorus:
  F                         G-7
I try to keep it simple so you understand
     Bb                         F
I'm giving all the love that I can
  F                         G-7
I try to keep it simple so you understand
     Bb                         F
I'm giving all the love that I can


Verse:
      F
On a fall day
          D-7
You would ask me
        Bb
For my love
   F      C
My friend
    F        C          D-7     Bb
You said that I could trust you
          F                C      F   C
Yeah you said you're gonna be my man

Ooh but one lie
Led to another
And I know that I lied myself
You see, one lie
Leads to another lie
But how many men do our lies kill?


Chorus

Verse:

Well give me your excuses
Lord knows I heard them all
So has your momma and the F.B.I.
And they're both listenin' through the wall

They say one lie
Leads to another
I told it to the policeman
He said: "One lie leads to another lie
"But how many lies kill how many men?"


Chorus

Bridge:
              D-
What part of love
                 A-
Don't you understand?
                   Bb
Say, what part of love
                 A-   C
Don't you understand?


Verse:

Some folks say
"Man, take it easy"
Some folks say
"Man, take a walk"
Well, maybe I'll take myself
On down to the river
And throw myself off the dock
When you
See my body floatin' on by
You can
Throw me down a wreath
Then you can send my bleedin' heart off the Washington
Attention: Commander In Chief

Woo!


Chorus

Ending:

Said I try to...
Keep it simple...
So you would...
Understand...
Said the only thing worse in the whole wide world is another solid man

Said the only thing worse in the god damn world would be another quiet man

You know I try to keep it simple
I give you all the love that I can
