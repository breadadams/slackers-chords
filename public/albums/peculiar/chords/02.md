Intro:

G C D


Verse:
           G                       C           D        G            C D
Well I committed no crime but it seems that I have no place to hide
         G                     C                      D
I had a bad disposition and a pistol, all loaded for suicide
 C                         D
And though I didn't act, that don't really matter
     E-                           G
The law books, they are fat, the lawyers, they get fatter
C                             D           C     D
  And I'll be lucky if they ship me to Siberia


Verse:

I got two mad women, no mother, and a brother who prays for me
And it's for my man Ivan if I'm lucky he'll take the blame for me
Or maybe I'll get loaded, end up in a fight
Or maybe I'll go down just like the other night
But I'll be lucky if they ship me to Siberia


Chorus:
                    G
Well, father was peculiar
              C             D         G      C
And now the fruit it don't fall too far away
     D        G
So what's it to ya?
   C                   D
If he was here, I know he would say,
         C                 D                  E-   G
No he'd tell ya, I didn't do the crimes you claim
         C                 D                   G   D
No he'd tell ya, I didn't do those things you say


Musical Interlude

Verse:

Well father was peculiar and we both ended up with the same girl
If you call me obsessive well it kind of underestimates my behaviour
Now everyone believes in an imminent conviction
Everybody knew my overall intentions
And I'll be lucky if they ship me to Siberia


Chorus:

Well, father was peculiar
And now the fruit it didn't fall so far away
So what's it to ya?
If he was here, I know he would say,
No he'd tell ya that I didn't do the crimes you claim
No he'd tell ya that I didn't do those things you say


Bridge:
          E-
Well the judge and the jury and the people in the city 
          A7
They all talk about (Talk, talk, talk...)
     E-
The people in my life like they're someone in a movie on 
      D
Your... Night... Out...


Verse:

Evidence is bad and it don't look like I'm getting' outta here
As for the man who really done it, well he fixed it up nice, made it very clear
Oh, but Ivan understands when everything is awful
You do just what you can, 'cause everything is lawful
And I'll be luck if he can break me outta here


Chorus


And I say, come on man

Well, father was peculiar
Yeah, so what's it to ya?
It didn't mean I did those crimes you say

Hey, I said

Well, father was peculiar
Yeah, so what's it to ya?
Still I didn't do those crimes you say

You say
You say

Father
Father was peculiar

Didn't mean I did those crimes...
