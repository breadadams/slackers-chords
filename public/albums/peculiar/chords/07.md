The Slackers - I'd Rather Die Happy (Chords)

Intro:

E B A E  x2


Verse:
E                 B         A              E
I sat myself down Tuesday, wrote myself a song
E                  B       A               E
Just things I want to say, about what is wrong
    A              E                A          E
But all of my complainin', well it comes to no avail
      A              E                A              B
The things I really need to say I've yet to learn myself


Chorus:
A            E    A             E
  I won't cry, no. And I won't wail, no
A           E           A           E
  I tell myself that you can never fail
           E     A
Until it's over
              E          A    E A E B
And when it's over, it's over


Verse:

So I wrote myself a letter, and I sent it off to you
To make myself feel better, I tried to tell the truth
I wrote a song for Jesus Christ, and one for Noah's Ark
I sang a song for mornin' light and I still sat in the dark


Chorus:

I won't cry, no. And I won't wail, no
I tell myself that you can never fail
Until it's over
And when it's over, it's over


Verse:

So I accept I can do nothing, do nothing at all
I see myself, a big, long road and I build myself a wall
I dig myself a tunnel, so I could get on under
And join the rest of the human race, just ask 'why?' and wonder


Chorus:

I won't cry, no. And I won't wail, no
I tell myself that you can never fail
Until it's over
And when it's over, it's over
