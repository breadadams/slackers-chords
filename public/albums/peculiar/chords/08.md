G Am C G


Verse:
G                         B-
  Give me a minute to compose myself, it's been
E-                       C
  Long, long time since you been gone
G                             E-
  I can still remember conversations we had
    D                               C      
To bad that's all that now lingers on
G                          B-
  So many times I nearly fooled myself that some...
E-                            C
  Body like you could give a damn about me
G                                E-
  But then one day you stepped into my life,
          D                       G
All my strife was a fleeting memory


Chorus:
C                      E-      D                 C
  Over and over in my head at night (What went wrong...)
C                                     E-      B                 C
  Didn't lose the battle, didn't give up the fight (What went wrong...)
C                            Em          D                 C      C/E
  To let you go then didn't make things right (What went wrong...)
                  C/G                         C-
  Can't hide the tears from my eyes now that love's gone and passed me by...


Verse:

Bearing my life I somehow steered you wrong
From the road once again was driving us away
I pushed aside the things that meant so much with hope
That you'd be happy some day
I wear regret now like the lines on my face
Not a day passes on that you don't cross my mind (You don't cross my mind...)
Couldn't raise the spirits of the broken heart
A chance presents itself what'd you do in kind


Chorus

                C/G                         C-
Can't hide the tears from my eyes now that love's gone and passed me...


Verse:

But then one day I gathered up the nerve
To trek on all these ways I thought not to cross
In for this pain that flow deep down inside
That still has the dreams that always know loss
Upon the threshold I now made my ascent
Towards the door I sure closed on one careless day (On one careless day...)
Written on a ledger (???) revealed
That your name, long gone, it faded away


Chorus:

Over and over in my head at night (What went wrong...)
Didn't lose the battle, didn't give up the fight (What went wrong...)
To let you go then didn't make things right (What went wrong...)
            C-
What went wrong...
                C                           C-
Can't hide the tears from my eyes now that love's gone and passed me...

 A
Love's gone
 C#-
Love's gone
 F#-
Love's gone
