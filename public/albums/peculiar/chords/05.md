Verse:
          E               G#m
Every time I see your face
                 C#m                          A
Oh don't you know that I can't stop thinkin' about you
             E                     G#m
And every time I caught your stare
                   C#m                       A
Well I was thinking, "I can't live without you"


Pre-Chorus:
G#m
  But every time I called you up
      C#
Your daddy said that you're not home
G#m
  And I fear, you're sittin' there
      B
Just waiting in your room alone


Verse:

Well maybe I can take you out
Some time we'll go see a movie
Yes I know you've got your secrets
But you can tell them to me


Pre-Chorus:

You don't have to say that you want me
And you don't have to say that you need me
If you just tell your daddy to call me
And I will tell him all so sweetly...


Chorus:
E                C#m                A
  Set the girl free (Set the girl free...)
           C#m  B
Set her to me
E                C#m                 A
  Set the girl right (Set the girl right...)
               C#m  B
And set her tonight
B
  Well I'll be waitin'
B/D#
  I'll be waitin'
B/F#              B7     E
  I'll be waitin' all...
