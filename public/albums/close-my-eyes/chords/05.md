Just from a three-letter word

War is all around us (war is all around us)

With your life, 'cause they don't care
No no no no no

War is all around us (war is all around us)
Fighting everywhere
Time to fight the real war (time to fight the real war)
Against hunger and poverty

For racial equality

Time to fight the real war (time to fight the real war)
For it affect you and me

(Time to fight the real war)
