Verse:
  E                   A             E
Clandestine, I could never be your boyfriend
A               E                            B7
  You took too serious the things I said in passing
    E                                   A           E
My pebbles of confusion you took like boulders and comandments
 A        E        B7           E
Never realisin' I had no understandin'


Chorus:
E          A               E
   Clandestine, oh Clandestine

I may go straight to hell
                      B7
You may say "Just as well"
        A                           E    C#7
   And no, I never meant to do no wrong
       E              B7        E
And I never meant to do ya any harm


Verse:

Clandestine, you find it much to easy
To keep secrets from me for your own protection
And this is something I, too, do inadvertant
But Clandestine you're supposed to be better than me


Chorus

Intrumental Interlude

Verse:

Clandestine, I just wanna thank you
You put me places that I may not have gone
I went to the Chinese doctor, he said my yin's deficient
He said my yang's sufficient, you said "I should have known"


Chorus
