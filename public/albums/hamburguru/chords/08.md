Verse:
        B                         E
Sister Jeanie came from Oklahoma
     B                                 E
She left when they tried to stone her
     B                                E
Her mother, she tried to disown her
     B                               E
She said she'd always been a loner


Well the other day she wrote me a letter
In which she asked me, please, to never forget her
She said if things get any better
She'll be dead by late September


Chorus:
        E                                 B
When I found out, she was already miles away
          E                    B                     C#    F#
Eighteen years, and eighteen wheels on that old highway
            E                                 B   Bb  A  Ab
And in her letter that I recieved just yesterday
            B                        F#                  B     E  B  F#
She said "Pray for me, papa, that we all don't just fade away"


Verse:

I remember the day we got talking
She had a brother uptown, I had called him
She picked up the phone, said "Come on over
"I'm a coffee girl and ??? in Harlem"

(Spoken) Well, that's exactly what she said
So I reached into my pocket for a token
And went and caught that train


Chorus


Verse:

Little sister, just so you know
Little girl, I love'a you so
If I never hear your voice go
I just listen for the wind


Chorus

Ending:
                     B                        F#                  B     Bb A Ab
You know she said "Pray for me, papa, that we all don't just fade away"
                B                        F#                  B     Bb A Ab
Oh, she said "Pray for me, papa, that we all don't just fade away"
                         B                        F#                  B     E B B7
Oh, you know she said "Pray for me, papa, that we all don't just fade away"
