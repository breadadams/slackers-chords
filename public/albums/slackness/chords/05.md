Intro:

F


Verse:

F                             D-
Is it time for me to take my pill?
          G-       C        F
Or is it time for me to die?
F                         D-
All I ever want to do is kill
        G-                   C
I don't even know the reason why

  C                               F
What's the use in looking at the past?
     C                      F
I'm happy now my world is grey
    A                          D
For all the horrors that they cast
        G-                    C
I'm not evil in that kind of way

C                      F
As to choose, I can't decide
     A                   Bb
The way I lose I can't abide
            Bb-       F       D-
And when I win, just for the ride
             G-         C     F
I watch the world coming, suicide
