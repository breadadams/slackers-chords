What I didn't do was lvoe you every night,
likfe I wanted to be alive if I couldn't love you

Verse:

I'll find another before this night's over
She may not be you, I might not be sober
But I'll make love with her until the mornin' light,
Thinkin' all the while, how I cold love you.

What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
What have I done wrong...
What have I done wrong that I should be sorry?
...That I should be sorry?
