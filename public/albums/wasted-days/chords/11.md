Verse:
E
  It will soon be after midnight
B                              E
  Long since the sun has gone down
E
  I'll be waitin' by your window
B                                 E
  'Til your feet they touch the ground


We'll hitch a ride down to the station
To catch a box car car train
Leaving trouble far behind us
And let the distance do the playing


Pre-Chorus:
E               E/F#  E/G#      A
  For can't you see I love you woman
                            E    C#-
Since I first laid eyes on you (yeah...)


Chorus:
       E
For tonight we'll be together
             B
There ain't nothin' they can do
D                           E
On this midnight rendezvous


Verse:

Before that day I was pre destined
To ride that same old lonesome track
Drifting right was my direction
Like smoke ejected from a stack

But from the time I came across you
My heart did burn with desire
With just a smile you held me captive
And set my world on fire


Pre-Chorus:

Please take a chance on us now, baby
If they will come to see it through (yeah...)


Chorus

Instrumental Interlude
(Over verse, pre-chorus and chorus changes)


Verse:

They're still marring our misfortunes
Laying all we have to waste
Trying to keep us separated
The moments lost can't be replaced

How can I promise you tomorrow
If I haven't got today?
But with some luck we'll surely make it
In love (???) their words can convey


Pre-Chorus:

Let's steal away now from the sorrow
And kiss goodbye the life we knew (yeah...)


Chorus x2

Ending:

E D  Etc.
