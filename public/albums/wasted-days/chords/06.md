Intro:

G C  x4


Verse:
G                 C
  So this is the night, well
G                       C
  Guess I'd better get ready
G                 D#
  So this is the night you're gonna...
D             C
  Break my heart

G                   G7
  Well this is my question
C                 C-
  If you've been wondering
G                E-
  Shoud I have trusted you, Lord
C    D       G
  From the start?


Chorus:
       D            G
'Cause I'll never trust
         D
No one again
                     G
I thought that some way
                C
This time'd be different
                  G
But it's just a drag
                  D/A
I thought it was fate
                 E-/B
But it's just a sin
                 C
The more that I wait
                 G
The less that I win
                 D
And I'll never trust
         C   D
No one again


Verse:

See I'm just a monkey
And she's just annoying
I didn't know until she...
Said goodbye

So this is the night, well
I like her reasons
They're just as good as
Some reasons of mine


Chorus

Bridge:
C           D                  E-
  It only spoils your happy moments
            G
To they're here in passing
C               C-
  And they are never lasting
D
  So this is the night...


Verse:

So this is your answer
That love is my cancer
That I must remove before she...
Takes me too

You let me go free
No one to hold me
Don't worry 'bout me, I won't...
I won't worry 'bout you


Chorus

Ending:

G                 C
  So this is the night, well   x3
G                 C
  So this is the night  x6
