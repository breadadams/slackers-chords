Verse:
F                   Bb
  Many places I've been
F                  Bb
  Many faces I've seen
        F                       Bb
But I still haven't found any place in this world
         F       C          Dm
Where a man can say he is free

F                    Bb
  Many people I've known
F                           Bb
  And many seeds that I've sown
        F                       Bb
But I still haven't found any place in this world
         F       C       F
Where a man can call his own
 C
So I'm walking on


Chorus:
F            Bb
  Walking on, walking on
F                Bb
  Walking on and on
       F                       Bb
No I still haven't found any place in this world
       F          C       F
And I wish I was walking home


Intro

Verse:

Many times that I've wondered
Why I'm here at all
But it's times like that the man will try and pull you under
And then that you must stand tall
Never stand at all


Chorus

Verse:

Many places I've been
Many faces I've seen
But I still haven't found any place in this world
Where a man can say he is free

Many people I've known
And many seeds that I've sown
But I still haven't found any place in this world
Where a man can call his own
So I'm walking on
