Lyrics:

[A]
Save a smile for me
Just a smile for me
Though you no longer love me
Save a smile for me
Just a smile for me
You've put so much above me

[B]
All these things that I think
Though I'm seldom thinking of you
And I stare in my drink
And the world tourns a soft, golden hue
It's true

[C]
So do one thing for me
Just one thing for me
I'll ask nothing else of you
Save a smile for me
Just a smile for me
Some day you'll be lonely too


Instrumental Break (Same Chords)


[B]
And though I know not the day
When our love slipped away
Never to return
But as day turns to night
Yeah, I think that you're right
That I'll never, ever learn

[C]
So do one thing for me
Just one thing for me
I'll ask nothing else of you
Save a smile for me
Just a smile for me
 G-7                C7     F   D7
Some day you'll be lonely too
 G-7                C7     F   D7
Some day you'll be lonely too
 G-7                C7          F
Some day you'll be lonely...
