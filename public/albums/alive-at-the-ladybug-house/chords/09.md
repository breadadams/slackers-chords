Verse:

Well there's a house on the corner that's yellow
And nobody lives inside
I think somebody tried to sell it
Oh, but nobody wanted to buy

So in come mean old winter
And in come father time
And in come the bad old summer
And nothing else here rhymes


Chorus:

Because the animals run the house
The animals run the house
I said the animals run the house
I said the animals run the house


Verse:

You know the postman come by
And he said "Man, I'm leavin'"
The meter man went inside
And he just ran out screamin'

Crazy mary said "Let's go drink a beer, man"
I said "Nah, nah I don't wanna go in there"
I said "It don't feel right man,
It feels it's some kind of sin, now"


Chorus


And then a cat walked up to me, man
And he looked at me and he said "Meow"
And the dog cam up and he looked and me and he went "Rrrrr"
And deep down, they were whisperin', man
Behind their little eyes, they were sayin'...
They were sayin'...


Free:

"Well, come in ant and mouse
Come in dog and monkey
Come in, oh man
It may seem unresolved and funky
You may feel all wrong
Man, you may feel all wrong now"
And they said, "Vic, if you do
It's 'cause you don't belong, now"


Chorus

Free:

And then all of a sudden, man
I started thinkin' to myself, man
Oh, things seem strange in there, they seem wrong
Nobody's payin' taxes in there, man
Nobody's got electric
Nobody's watchin' the TV set, man
Everything's, like...
There ain't no floors, man, that's just dirt
The walls are all grimy
It's almost like...
Nature, or something, in there man


Verse:

And there were snakes in the floor
There were earthworms in the couch
There was amoebas on the bed
There was... There was... On the doorknob

There were spiders in the walls
There was rats on in the bed
There was a lemur in the old TV set
And there's a big bullfrog in the head
And there's a big bullfrog in the head
And there's a big bullfrog in the head
And there's a big bullfrog in the head
