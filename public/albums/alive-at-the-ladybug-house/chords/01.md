Verse:

I may not ammount to nothing you would like to know
And I may like to count the fingers wrapped around my throat
But I may have and ace that you wold really like to see
There in the lights on Saturday night, well


Chorus

Bridge:
Bm                   Am
  You picked me up, just so you could walk me on down
Bm                    Am
  The crooked stares, I recieved from you and your friends
Bm                      Am
  There at the house, starin' like some elephant who
C                D
  Sees a mouse, pullin' on that guillotine string


Verse:

You and I went places I did not expect to go
You had showed me faces I did not expect I'd know
But you threw me in traffic that was anything but slow
Out at the light on Saturday night, well


Chorus

Oh, how mean and nasty you were
Oh, how mean and nasty you were
Oh, how mean and nasty you were
