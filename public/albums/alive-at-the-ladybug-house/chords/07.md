Vic Ruggiero – Parking Lot (Chords)


Verse:

  D                       G         D
Things fall to pieces and I’m happy about it
G         D
  Happy about it
G         A
  Happy about it
  D                            G               D
Hear the people screaming in their respective houses
G              D
  Respective houses
G             A
  Respective mouses


Chorus:

Bm                      G              D
I don’t need to die in your field of green, no
G                 A
  I don’t really care a lot
Bm                   G            D
I don’t know exactly what you’ve seen, but
G          D          A         D
  I’m at peace in your parking lot


Verse:

I don’t spend my summer times waiting for sunshine
I like the nighttime
I see my own line
There inside the blue and rising summer moonlight
A blinking blue light
In your room, right


Chorus:

I don’t need to die ‘neath your castle wall or
Tears you cry for Camelot
Well I would be surprised if I cared at all ‘cause
I’m at peace in your parking lot


Bridge:

Bm
  Set your Moses on mountains high
G                A
  Ravens crying nevermore
Bm
  Point my feet at some grand ravine, but
G                       A
  I’ve seen more in your dresser drawer


Verse:

Wouldn’t state my reasons just to have you hate me
So irate and
So exterior
If you should discover, then Lord please remember
I’m a member of
nothing in particular


Chorus:

I don’t need to die for your royal grace or
Wars on economic thought
No I didn’t show just to run your race, man
I’m at peace in your parking lot


Verse:

Father loses everything he’s worked his life for
So chalk another up
Too experienced
Though the (???) breath was (???) the grand appearance
Keep aware of
Who’s moving near us


Chorus:

I don’t need to die in your field of green, no
I don’t really care a lot
Would it be so wrong just to say that all I
Want is peace in your parking lot
I’m at peace in your parking lot
I’m at peace in your parking lot
