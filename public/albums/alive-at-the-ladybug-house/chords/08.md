Intro  x1

Verse:

Blindfolds that they put on me
Make them think that I can't see
All the tricks they try to do
Just to keep me away from you

Let them, let them think they can
'Cause I'm just a little man
But they don't know what I do

I been a lonely man for you


Chorus:
                  C#m
Now what could I say
                F#m
With you gone away
             A               G#m
And some wish that you would
          F#m                B7
But that don't do me no good
              C#m
What could I do
               F#m
Baby, without you
             A             G#m
Bullet, bomb, gun or knife
    F#m                B7
To keep you in my life


Verse:

Good Lord, it's a dreadful sin
This kind of world I'm living in
Papers don't tell me no news
Make the chices I should choose
First they said that we are free
Self-contained in apathy
Good Lord, it's technology
That tries to take you away from me


Chorus:

Now what could I say
With you gone away
And some wish that you would
But that don't do me no good
What could I do
Baby, without you
Bullet, bomb
Gun or knife
To keep you in my life


Verse:

Oh, my baby, yes, it's true
I've been a lonely man for you
Good Lord knows that yes, it's true
I've been a lonely man for you

I'm so lonely, oh so lonely
I've been a lonely man for you
So lonely, so lonely, Lord I'm so lonely
I'm a lonely man, for you


Ending:

E, G#m, F#m
