Vic Ruggiero - 'Til the Early Morning (Chords)


Intro:

F


Verse:

 F
Sit me down and make me sigh
                             C        Dm
Won't you tell me, sister, why it's true
        Bb                  F
That it all comes back for you

 F
Sit me down and make me smile
                          C      Dm
Turn my teardrops for a while into
  Bb               F
Another shade of blue


Chorus:
   C      Bb   F
So I can carry on
 C        Bb     Dm
Until the early morning
     C
When I can say
    Bb        F
I changed my mind


Verse:

Sit me down and make me eat
Tell me sister, why your meat's so sweet
As your song is tender

Lie me down and make me sleep
Tell me why these poor eyes love to weep
Because I can't remember


Chorus:

But I can carry on
Until the early morning
When I can say
I changed my mind


Verse:

Take my shoes, make me walk
Don't you know my feet, they're pretty soft
See, I'm a city boy

Tie me tight and watch me drown
And hang my picture from a post in town
That says "Missing since July"


Chorus:

So I can carry on
Until the early morning
When I can say
I changed my mind


Instrumental Interlude

Chorus:

Oh yes, I can carry on
Until the early morning
When I can say
I changed my mind


Verse:

Sit me down, make me drink
Now I know why I so fear to blink
To prove I was not dreamin'

Whiskey red and coffee blue
California deja vu and you
And the last day I believed in


Chorus:

But I can carry on
Until the early morning
When I can say
I changed my mind

Yes, I can carry on
Until the early morning
When I can say
I changed my mind
