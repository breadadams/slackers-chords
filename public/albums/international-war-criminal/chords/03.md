Intro:

E G#7 C#- A


Chorus:
E       G#7      C#-    A7
  International war criminal
E       G#7  C#-  A7
  Information is minimal
     E              G#7
The weapons of destruction
          C#-             A7
They are gasoline and petroleum
E               G#7               C#-      A7
  And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
E           G#7               C#-      A7
  Are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?


Verse:
E                         G#7
  In the old days all them teachers taught me
C#-                            A
  In the old books that their Cold War bought me
E                            G#7
  They said like dominos this whole wide world could
C#-                         A
  Fall to pieces like they wish that old Middle East would


Chorus:

But international war criminal
Information is minimal
The weapons of destruction
They are gasoline and petroleum
So are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
Are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?


Verse:

I heard they found one in a hole, man
White lights crawlin' on his brown skin
But ain't it shameful just being human?
No, it's old as original sin that white light's always creepin' in


Chorus

Verse:

International rules of war, they get spoken
When it suits someone to have them broken
It's funny how they'll go on and define "terror"
As killing and exploding things to force your own agenda


Chorus:

But international war criminal
Situation is pitiful
The weapons of destruction
They are gasoline and petroleum
And are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
Are you stickin' 'round to see what happens?
International war criminal
International war criminal
Situtaion, Lord, it's pitiful
International war criminal
