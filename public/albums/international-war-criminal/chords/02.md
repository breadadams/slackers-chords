Intro:

D- A


Chorus:
D-
I'm just a rider
   G-           D-
A rider on the rail
D-                       A7
I'm just a rider on the rail
  D-
Where's this train a-going?
   G-            D-
*(Fuck if I can tell)
                A7           D-
But I'm just a rider on the rail


Verse:
      D-
Don't ask the captain, please
    G-                  D-
To tell you what's the reason
            D-        A       D-
'Cause I'm sure he's long forgotten
     D-
The days when he was young,
        G-             D-
And he carried by the ton,
               A7       D-
Your corn and coal and cotton.


Chorus:

*(Well, far as I can tell)


Verse:

Now stand in your place,
And man, don't look in my face
'Cause I'll do for you no favor
With no sense of remorse,
We'll stay our plotted course
From this we will not waver

If you want my reasons for
Just why I joined the war
Well I'll tell you, I, I had to
'Cause when they tell you, "Son,
Stand straight and take this gun"
Well they also point one at you


Chorus:

*(Prob'ly straight to hell)


Ending:

You can call me captain,
You can call me what you will
But I'm just a rider on the rail
I'm just a rider on the rail
Well I'm just a rider on the rail (Etc.)
