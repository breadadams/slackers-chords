You know, you know, you know
It's no good to be in love
You know, you know, you know

When you're not loved
When you're not loved

When you're not loved
It always pains
When you're not loved


I can never sleep
I can only weep
I can never sleep
I can only weep
I can never sleep
I can only weep
I can never sleep
I can only weep

All night
Well the clock says it's time to go...
