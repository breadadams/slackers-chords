Verse:

I won't cause any complication
No, no complication (for you)
And I won't bother to contradict my opinion
Because you tell (me to)


Chorus

Bridge (Same chords):

Dinga-linga ling
Hear the churchbell ring
Yes, Lord, I can hear the children sing
This is their part of town
And nothing in thew world can bring them down
The good Lord's brought them together on this day
Dictator oppressor man, you have no power
For you will see you've lost it within this hour
The children have been brought up strong
And in my eyes they can do no wrong
For they are the future for us all
They're gonna give it all they've got
Until they reach freedom, they just won't stop
They're only trying to save our souls


Chorus
