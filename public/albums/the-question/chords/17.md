The Slackers - Alone Again (Chords)


Verse:

(No chords are actually played in this verse)

       E
Every day
                F#-   B           E
I pray a little bit about your love

Every day
                     F#-       B        E
You seem to be the thing I'm thinking of
                   F#-   B            E
But what I do for you I just can't say
                 F#-     B           E
Considering the kind of games you play
                     F#-       B          E
You say you do one thing and then the next
                F#-      B         G#-   C#
Minute you are gone, so long, I'm moving on
    F#-   B      E
And I'm alone again


Oh, some day
I hope to see your face around again
Come and play
Is what you used to say to me, my friend
Every time you finally pull me out
Your little hide and seek just makes me shout
I barely got to twenty-one and you were gone
And I'm alone again


Instrumental Interlude

Verse:

Every day
I pray a little bit about your love
Every day
You seem to be the thing I'm thinking of
But what I do for you I just can't say
Considering the kind of games you play
You say you do one thing and then the next
Minute you are gone, so long, I'm moving on
And I'm alone again
