Intro:
Bb-  Gb7


Verse:
Bb-
    You know I'm tryin' so hard
Gb7
    To pull you in
Bb-
    You keep lookin' away
Gb7
    There we go again

Eb-
    I wanna be with you
Bb-
    But I have no choice
Eb-
    I wanna be with you
F7
   Listen to my voice


I keep walkin' all day
Need a place mybaby can stay
When I call you up
You've got nothin' to say

Been reachin' deep inside
Tryin' to share my life
But when you close your heart
Feels like the twist of a knife


Chorus:
Db                                 F-
  Don't make me come right out and say
Eb-                                Db  Ab
  'Cause you know that's not my style
Db                               F-
  Why don't you walk right over here
Eb-                Db  Ab7
  And try to me smile?


Verse:

Sometimes I see that pain (Ooh ooh...)
Deep in you
And all them silly things
We make eachother do

And now I realise
That I've been so blue
And now I realise
You feel the same way too
