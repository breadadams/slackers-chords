                        C
She called me up on the sly
                                 A-
She said "Please don't tell all your friends
                            F
Because they might tell my husband
                             F-
And then you know I'll never see you...

And I'm sure he would beat me too
                       F
So I called you on the sly
G                                 C
  Please don't ask cause you know why.

      E                                  F         G

Yeah, but that just made it double
                          F
More intriguing than the conversation
                              F-
I said i'll meet you at the station


Still I couldn't help but think
As I drank my beer to meet her,
"What the hell'm I doin' here?
And what the hell'm I gonna say?

Take some time and have a drink
      G7                     C          G
And think about what you're gonna do to me
                            D-      G7
And married girl ain't you worried,
                      C      A-
If our love is kinda hurried
                             D-
That you'll be left wanting more
        G7              C       G       C
In the time after your man has murdered me


Spoken (Over Verse(B) chords):

Baby, when I saw you, I knew that I was a goner...
And all those things I meant to say, well,
I just forgot in our first kiss...


Verse (B):

We threw your husband in that river
You know it made me kinda shiver
We sent flowers to his mother
All so we could see each other...

It lasted for about three weeks
And now we dont even speak
And so I'm sitting here alone
And I'm sitting on the phone...


Chorus

Ending:

...That you'll be left wanting more
        G7              C       G       C
In the time after your man has murdered me...
