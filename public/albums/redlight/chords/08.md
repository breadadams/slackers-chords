Verse:
C#
  There beneath the morning sun
F#           G#
  I see you walking
C#
  Smiling face for everyone
F#           G#
  I see you talking
C#
  Too shy to call your name (too shy)
F#              G#
  Too hard to play these games
       C#
I was weak in my heart
                              F# G#
That would tear us apart now


Pre-chorus:
 F#                        G#
Nothing can turn back the hands of time
     F#               G#
And nothing can ever make you mine


Chorus:
 C#
Keep on...
         F#    G#
Keep on walking (Oh baby got to...)
 C#
Keep on...
         F#           G#
Keep on walking (Yeah)


Verse:

Morning turns to afternoon
And you're stil standing
My morning just can't end too soon
(Why you waiting?)
Too shy to call your name (Too shy)
Too hard to play this game
All the boys that you know
How they come and they go


Pre-chorus:

But your pot, it boiled much too hot
And nothing, no nothing, canchange this lot

Verse:

Afternoon turns to eveningtime
And I see you dancing
Smiling face for every man
I see you romancing
Too shy to call your name
Too hard to play these games
I was weak in my heart
That would tear us apart now

Nothing can turn back the hands of time
And nothing can ever make you mine

Oh baby got to keep on
Just move on

Just move on
Walking, walking, walking, yeah

I'm gonna tell you the truth now
Yeah, baby
