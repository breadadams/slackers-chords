Intro:
F


Verse:
F                  Db7
   Where are you tonight my love?
F                         G-7        C7
   This I'm asking to the stars up above
F                   D7           D#7
   When will you be coming home?
G-7             C7          F
   'Cause I'm afraid to be alone


Pre-Chorus:
C7                D7
   Long before we met that summer
D#7      D7           G-7          C7
   I was sure I would never love another
F                    D7             D#7
   Now I know I was wrong, so wrong
G-7         C7              F       G-7 C7
   My honey why you gone so long?


Chorus:
F                 G-7        C7
   Come back baby, come back baby
F            D7        G-7               C7
   Come back baby, the joke is done, now come on home
F
   Distance makes a heart grow fonder
D7                                    D#7
   But honey you don't have to wander
G-7           C7  F                    G-7 C7
   To make me say those three words...


Instrumental Interlude (Verse, Pre-Chorus)

Pre-Chorus:
C7                     D7
  My head is heavy, my heart is filled with pain
D#7     D7        G-7            C7
  And I fear that feeling will remain
F                              D7                   D#7
  Go to sleep, go to sleep, I pray you find the one
G-7             C7                 F
  And then I'll dream you're in my arms
      G-7       C7
  And I'll keep asking you...


Chorus

G-7           C7  F                    G-7 C7
   To make me say those three words...


Ending:
F
