Intro:

Eb F Bb  (Etc.)


Chorus:
                  Eb   F
Said you must be good
                  Bb
So that you can sleep at night
                 Eb   F
And you must be good
              Bb
So that your mamma can hold you tight
                  Eb            F
And you can't be bad, can't be bad
                   Bb
Or the devil come lick you
                   Eb                F
Whoah you must be good, you must be good
                    Bb
No, don't let him trick you


Verse:
          Eb  F                 Bb
Oh every day,   tempted by temptation
           Eb        F         Bb
And every night by another situation
                 Eb       F        Bb
But you must be wise, be wise and recognise
        Eb                  F                    Bb
Or the devil come pull you down in a girlish disguise


Chorus

Verse:

Avarice and envy, lord these sins are deadly
Greed and vanity now, they hurt a good man plenty
But you must take care now, and beware in your youthful insobriety
Your cup may be full now, but in the end it will be empty.

Chorus

I said you must be good, you must be good
Don't let him trick you
I said you must be good, you must be good
You must be good...
