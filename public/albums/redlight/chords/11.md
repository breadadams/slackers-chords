Chorus

You have to be rude and reckless
It'll make you a man
You have to be rude and reckless
Don't misunderstand
Women will try to run you
And when they're done
You'll be a nice young man
Not too much fun
You have to be hard and callous
You have to be strong
You have to rude and reckless
Don't be all wrong
You have to be a no hesitation
Don't think too much
Cause a good love is sayin'
Of a hand that leave a touch


Verse:

I said now Papa
I'm just a boy
I want to get groovy
I want to bring joy
He said that's well and good
For the son of a richer man
But that ain't you now sonny
Please, please understand


Chorus:

You have to be rude and reckless
It's part of the plan
You have to be rude and reckless
Do right by your fellow man
There should be no political correctness
You have to drive fast
You have to be strong
You have to be strong
You have to be rude and reckless...
