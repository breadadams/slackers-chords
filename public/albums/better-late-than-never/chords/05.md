Verse:

Two face (two face, two face)
You said you were my brother
Oh, but, two face,
You must have meant another
'Cause I jumped in when you were drownin'
But you jumped down and held me down in
The water, just like a baptism day
I said man, you better watch your way, yeah
I said man, you better watch your way, yeah
Well man, you better watch your way...
