C                        G-
  Have you ever heard a voice that tells you
C                                G-

C                    G-

Intro (only x2)

Verse:

Do you know the way to another town?
Have you got a smile to give me when I'm down?
Two books for a uptown fare
Just take care, wake me when I'm there?

"This train's making all local stops"
I didn't pay my fare, but don't tell the cops
Look out, there's a signal up against us
It won't matter when the bombs go off


Chorus:

'Cause I'll be walkin' with myself,
Talkin' with myself
And waiting, waiting,
For the next train to come


Bridge:
C G-                    C
     Now it's come and gone
G-                           C
   And I've been waiting so long
G-                         C
   The train has come and gone
G-                           C
   And I've been waiting so long


Intro

Verse:

There was a guy on the train last week
I couldn't tell if he's a beggar or a thief
Two guys chased him down the track
They went there, and no they never came back

I'm sure there's some place he'd rather be
Than stuck underground with the likes of me
When we're gone, will the trains keep on rolling?
When we're dead, will the soldiers be patrolling?


Chorus:

Talking with myself, walking with myself
And waiting, waiting, for the next train
Walking with myself, talking with myself
And waiting, waiting, for the next train

Walking with myself, talking with myself
And waiting for the next train to come


Ending (Chorus Chords):
C Bb                    A-
     Now it's come and gone
Ab                G          C
   And I've been waiting so long

The train has come and gone
And I've been waiting so long
The train has come and gone
And I've been waiting so long
And I've been waiting so long
The train has come and gone
And I've been waiting so long
So long, so long...
