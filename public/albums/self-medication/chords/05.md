Intro:

E


Verse:
      E                   G#               A   E
The stars that wouldn't shine, they don't go away
 E                     G#               A      E7
Just 'cause you don't see them shinin' here today
      A                   F#-               E         C#-
The stars that wouldn't shine just haven't been seen here
      F#-           B          A       E
And they may not arrive for a million years


The stars that wouldn't shine have been left for dead
Because they take their time you haven't seen them yet
They may not arrive for a million days
It don't mean they don't try to make it through the haze


Chorus:
      E         E7        A
The stars that wouldn't shine
      E         E7        A    G
The stars that wouldn't shine


Verse:

They cross the darkened skies like a ghostly ship
And because they deny your eyes you like to say they don't exist
They may not reach these shores until we're all long dead
But like the lights you're seein' now, they too are light years ahead


Chorus

Instrumental Break

Verse:

The stars that wouldn't shine, they don't mean you no harm
They mean to help you, keep you safe and warm
And if their loving fingers haven't found you yet
I will remind you, lest you forget


Chorus:

The stars that wouldn't shine   (x10)
