Intro:

Bb F Ab Eb   x4


Verse:
Bb                            F
  They shot down the marchers on a winter's day
        Ab                             Eb
Laying face-down in the snow as their lives ran away
Bb                                    F
  Now the distance between us, grows more every day
Ab                             F
Every time I see you, it just makes me wanna say


Short Chorus:
           Bb             F
Don't you want a man any more?
           Ab             Eb
Don't you need a man any more?
           Bb                F
Don't you love your man any more?
           Ab                Eb
Don't you want your man any more?


Verse:

So the revolution came and it went away
Everyone was saved, my lord, but things pretty much stayed the same
And now the distance between us grows further every day (Further every day)
Every time I see you, it just makes me wanna say


Chorus:
           Bb             F
Don't you want a man any more?
           Ab             Eb
Don't you need a man any more?
           Bb                F
Don't you want this man any more?
           Ab                Eb
Don't you love this man any more?
           Bb                F
Don't you want your man any more?
           Ab                Eb
Don't you need your man any more?
           Bb                F
Don't you love your man any more?
                C
Only time will tell


Bridge:
Ab                                  Eb                          Bb
  Before this all began, there's a lot of things we could have been
Ab                          Eb      Bb
  In many ways, we were just  children
Ab                              Eb       Bb
  And all these nights as we lay  slumberin'
               F
We should have opened up our hearts

And let each other in

Verse:

Well the man withthe book in his hand just turned the page
As another actor cried out and was pulled on off the stage
And now the distance between us, grows further every day
Every time I see you, it just makes me wanna say


Chorus:

Don't you want a man any more?
Don't you need a man any more?
Don't you want your man any more?
Don't you need your man any more?
Don't you love this man any more?
Don't you need this man any more?
Don't you love this man any more?
Only time will tell
