Verse:
            E7
Well have I ever
                B7
Seen a lady so lovely?
     E7
Only once or twice
                    A7
And that was in a dream
       E7
And I hope
                       A7
Hope and pray she can help me

Verse:

When I seen her
I figured I should maybe try
But could a boy, a boy like me
Get with a girl who looks so fine?
And when I spoke, she turned away
But then I heard her say


Chorus Chords:

Hey, boy, come here
And don't you have no fear
And then we walked that walk
And we talked that talk

And then I held her hand
And she held mine
And when I touched her hair
Yeah it felt so fine
